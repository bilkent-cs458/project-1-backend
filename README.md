## CS 458  Project 1 Backend

The backend for the first project of CS458, which is a Netflix Clone.

The frontend of the project is in its own repo, under the same organization.

Our versions:

* Node.js: `14.16.0`

* NPM: `6.14.11`

#### To run:
1. Make sure you have Node and NPM installed. To check if they are installed in your system, run: `node -v` and `npm -v`.
   If you get any errors, you might need to refer to the [Node.js Installation Guide](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).


2. Once you have confirmed that you have Node and NPM installed correctly, you can pull the repo, `cd` into the folder
   that Git just created for you, and run: `npm i && npm run start`
   

3. The `express.js` REST API should now be listening at port 3001 of your local machine.
